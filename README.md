# Studing Localization in Unknown Environments Using Neural Networks and Machine Learning

This project is a study of neural networks applied to a dataset of car locomotion with sensors. The KITTI dataset provides several useful data for working with neural networks, making it possible to study neural network training approaches and pose (location) predictions, with the aim of achieving autonomous displacement.
